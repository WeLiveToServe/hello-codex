Abstract
This paper validates a local-first **ASR** pipeline that captures
speech through **push-to-talk (PTT)**, transcribes with low
**latency**, and routes text through optional **agentic** modules. A
minimal set of deterministic contracts enables predictable artifacts,
rapid triage, and safe orchestration without blocking future scale.

1/ Quickfacts, Runbook, and Memory Seeds
Quickfacts lock the execution frame: Windows 11, PowerShell 7, Python 3.12,
and a lightweight virtual environment. The workflow is local-first: audio
lives only long enough to reach the transcriber, while text persists as
the primary artifact. One PowerShell command launches the full path and
always prints absolute locations of outputs or failure artifacts.

The Runbook hard-codes five invariants.  
(1) One-line invocation.  
(2) Observable side effects: logs, debug HTML, and rolling transcripts.  
(3) **Separation of concerns**—recorder, transcriber, UI, agents, flow,
sessions, and tests never overlap responsibilities.  
(4) Stable menus and exit codes for automation.  
(5) Tests target what users see, not hidden state.

Memory Seeds store UX defaults that rarely change: short flags, fixed
banner width, colored status lines, deterministic filenames
(session-name.txt and .md), and a strict post-record menu: save, append,
copy, retry, or dispatch to an agent. By merging seeds into code and
tests, the system gains behavioral immutability; refactors cannot alter
public contracts unnoticed.

2/ Whisper Dictation Push to Talk App with Agentic Capabilities
The application binds five core modules:

Recorder listens for the PTT key, debounces events, and streams uniform
audio chunks tagged with timestamps and a finalize signal. It normalizes
PCM parameters and can write transient .wav files when remote **ASR**
requires media uploads.

Transcriber consumes chunks, applies silence gating, and calls Whisper via
**streaming inference** or batch decode. It scrubs disfluencies, normalizes
whitespace, and can compute inline **WER** when reference text exists.
Transcriber returns clean strings or token streams, abstracting away model
details.

UI shows banners, live timers, and a deterministic menu. Every choice
yields a side effect (file write, clipboard copy, agent call) and prints
an absolute path. Presentation logic resides here; no recording or model
logic bleeds in.

Agents are pure functions. *Agent Moneypenny* feeds transcript into an LLM
and returns score, reasons, and action hints. *Agent Maxwell* reshapes raw
text into concise coding prompts. Agents accept cost limits, expose dry-run
modes, and output JSON schemas that tests can validate.

Flow orchestrates these parts. It wires recorder ? transcriber ?
UI actions ? sessions and agents. Flow alone knows global routing and owns
error handling. A single PowerShell command (`python flow.py`) traverses
all branches while guaranteeing an artifact.

Sessions persist artifacts. Plain text stores raw transcripts; Markdown
stores enriched logs with agent replies. Naming policy embeds timestamps
or user labels for easy grep. Even on crash, the flow writes a stub file
so debugging starts with a clickable path, not guesswork.

Tests assert side effects: files exist, paths print, exit codes are
correct, and JSON schemas hold. Internals stay private, keeping tests
stable across refactors or backend swaps.

3/ Code Blocks & Thematic Structure
Recorder
- Opens sounddevice stream, registers callback, queues frames, converts to
  **pydub** segments when necessary.  
- Signals end-of-snippet on key release.  
- Writes optional .wav for offline or batch decode.

Transcriber
- Streams buffered audio to OpenAI Whisper with chunk timestamps.  
- Provides both `live_transcribe` (yield tokens) and
  `transcribe_and_enhance` (return final string).  
- Supports off-network fallback by loading a local model if configured.  
- Cleans output and can compute **WER** in diagnostic mode.

UI
- Prints 45-char banners, green spinning indicators while recording,
  typewriter effect for agent responses.  
- Post-record menu is deterministic: digits 1-7 map to fixed actions.  
- Emits `print_session_concluded()` and divider lines to mark logical
  end-points for log parsing.

Agents
- `agent_moneypenny(text)` ? JSON(score, reasons, reply).  
- `agent_maxwell(text)`   ? JSON(prompt, doctrine, reply).  
- Both enforce token caps, cost guards, and dry-run mocks for tests.

Flow
- Central `main()` calls `record_chunks_push_to_talk`, pipes chunks to
  transcriber, hands text to UI, and dispatches agents.  
- On any exception, writes debug HTML (if present) and a failure stub,
  then exits with non-zero code.  
- Always prints absolute paths for artifacts, making CI log scraping
  trivial.

Sessions
- `sessions.py` handles naming, file writes, and markdown stitching.  
- `.txt` stores raw chronological transcript separated by `---`.  
- `.md` embeds rich transcript, agent JSON pretty-printed, and a footer
  reference.

Tests
- `test_live_transcripe.py` drives recorder stub, transcriber stub, and UI
  through a full round trip, asserting artifact creation and exit code 0.  
- Additional tests verify agent schema and menu stability.

4/ Future Goals
Orchestration — Wrap current flow in **@task** and **@flow** decorators,
parameterize chunk size, model choice, and agent list, then schedule runs
or expose a REST trigger.

Agent teams — Build a dispatcher that routes transcripts through ordered
roles (summarizer ? critic ? rewrites). Enforce a bounded turn budget and
shared memory dictionary keyed by message ID.

Evaluation — Bundle a harness that replays fixed audio, times each stage,
computes latency buckets, and tracks WER. For agents, measure reduction in
editing time using rubric-scored prompts.

Portability — Provide optional `soundfile` backend, `pynput` keyboard
fallback, and an offline model toggle. Harden error codes and guarantee a
debug artifact on every crash.

Governance — Surface token counts, rate limits, and per-session budgets in
logs. Add a `--dry-run` flag that mocks agent calls and skips billing.

Dev Experience — Ship `lint.ps1`, `test.ps1`, and `run_smoke.ps1` that
respect the **one-command** rule and print absolute paths for every
written file.

5/ Conclusion
The recorder, transcriber, UI, agents, and flow form a compact kernel that
turns speech into enriched text while never hiding state. Deterministic
interfaces, observable artifacts, and side-effect tests make refactor
risk-free. Scaling to scheduled runs or agent teams is additive, not
destructive, because every boundary already has typed contracts and cost
guards.

-Appendix B - Concepts
**Deterministic Interfaces**  
A deterministic interface pins inputs, outputs, and side effects. When
every artifact path and exit code is stable, users and tests gain perfect
observability. Improvements then focus on internals without breaking
scripts or mental models.

**Agentic Orchestration**  
Agentic orchestration treats each enrichment step as a cost-bounded,
schema-verified function. Structured I/O allows chaining roles into teams
without tangling state. Budgets and dry-runs prevent cost blowouts.

**Local-first ASR**  
Local-first keeps audio transient and text durable. Privacy improves,
network outages hurt less, and latency stays predictable. Remote decode
remains optional, but lifecycle boundaries stay explicit.

**Evaluation as a Feature**  
Building latency and accuracy measurement into the product yields
continuous insight. Trends, not absolutes, guide defaults and flag
regressions early.

-Appendix C - Glossary of Terminology
**ASR** – Automatic Speech Recognition, audio ? text.  
**PTT** – Push-to-talk; hold key to capture, release to stop.  
**Chunking** – Dividing audio into fixed windows for decode.  
**Latency** – Time between speech and visible text.  
**WER** – Word Error Rate; accuracy metric vs reference text.  
**Streaming Inference** – Emitting partial tokens before final output.  
**Artifact** – Material file proving execution (txt, md, html).  
**Schema** – Agreed structure of JSON or message objects.  
**Capability Envelope** – Documented limits where a model behaves predictably.  
**Orchestrator** – Tool that sequences **@task** steps into a **@flow**.
