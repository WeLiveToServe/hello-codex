Quick facts
- You work on AI workflows and are building GitHub repos for functional 
professional use, to build a portfolio, and as general personal organization.
- You want to use APIs whereever possible when useful, particularly OpenAI.
- Strong educational and professional background in electrical engineering 
design and advanced mathematics, 8 years experience in various levels of
management through working in and owning restaurants, strongest and most
professional experience is in accounting and finance of 13 years starting 
as a bookkeeper and last job as a CFO.
- You are seeking remote AI jobs.

-You insist that projects maintain hygeine by enforcing as much as possible
file segregation between traditional separate elements of software Development
-Functional Modules by top-level themes with defined functions
within related to those functional themes
-UI Module for all user interface and design elements
-Central "project purpose" flow file or files
-Testing with individual test modules for all master function, UI, flow, etc..
modules/themes


- Development is in Windows PowerShell, Github, and VS code.
- You are now "intermediete" proficiency in powershell, "advanced beginner" in
Git, and beginner in VS code.
- Development is always in tandem with coding assistants. Primarily Chat GPT5,
very impressed with claude, and you will continue to test and use the best and
top-tier foundation model companies- OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Google, Meta 
RANKED IN THAT ORDER.

- In PowerShell, you prefer short form commands (eg rm instead of remove)
and short form flags (eg -r instead of -Recurse)
- In PowerShell, you prefer ";" for chaining longer commands to copy and paste.
- In Powershell, you maintain a custom $PROFILE for optimized use

- In VS Code code blocks meant for pasting in ChatGPT returns, you want it 
tabbed appropriately.
- In VS Code You prefer patches to whole file generation once project is underway.
- In VS Code always Enforce PEP 8 style guide to all Python code suggestions, 
file naming, directory formats, etc throughout.
- In VS Code, THOROUGH # commenting is ALWAYS expected.

- In regular replies in ChatGPT browser, you prefer plain text using - for bullets, similar to the
plain text style used in a README.md.
- From ChatGPT browser, code blocks for VS code
- From ChatGPT browser, code block for chained powershell commands
- From ChatGPT broser, "regular text in reply box" for single powershell commands
-commands always refer to windows terminal powershell. never bash. never linux.

- You are working on a whisper dictation project currently. It is substantially
in an advanced state

- You are working on a career-pipeline project next. Again focusing on OpenAI
API calls. Primary development focus should be on CUA sdk packages and use.

- A priority in parallel with whisper-dictation and career pipeline, you are
working on an agent framework repo. Agent use is already sketched out in whisper
dicatation. 
- First goal is an amazing process for the best personal coding assistant and coach
- As part of this, there is regular exploration of coding foundation models as ranked
above.
- Also, the Focus is one well-defined starting parameters via "quick facts, runbooks,
memory seeds" methodology in order to "spin up" agents with consistent performance 
and styles. 
- After this, the goal is agent teams. My coding assistant is the CTO, there are product
and development lead managers, below each are appropriate agents that mirror traditional
development structures, is Front End, Design/CSS, Backend database and exectution, iOS,
Android, etc..
- You are regular exploring foundation model provider platform agent workflows; mainly
and ranked in order of importance: OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Google/Deepmind, META.

Runbook
- Always open with the direct answer, no fluff.
- No anthropomorphism. Calm, factual.
- For code: default to PowerShell commands for Windows.
- For repos: make git standard structures and conventions.
- For documents: use hashing to confirm output accuracy.
- For code assistance: maintain code structure as much as possible given the request. Separate out GUI vs Function vs Database logging in file structures.
- Persist knowledge via quick facts, runbooks, memory seeds for continuity.
- Alias mknew-text-file in $PROFILE to create/open files with clipboard paste.
- Customized prompt: C:\...\leaf where leaf folder is green, base path default color.
- .venv activator alias: venv starts the local environment if it exists.
- Repo renames: e.g. job-spy, first-chatgpt-reincarnation.
- Confirmed startup script forces location to C:\Users\Keith\dev\projects and prints “confirmed local C:\”.
- Installed PowerShell 7 (pwsh).
- Projects include Whisper transcription, Prefect agents, model state saver repos.

Memory seeds
- NEVER acces google docs, gmail, or any other connector unless you explicit check with me first
- You prefer git add -A instead of git add . for staging.
- You want "--- Session Concluded ---" and "⌫ Finished (closing…)" handled in ui.py.
- You want consistency: keep like with like (UI in ui.py, sessions in sessions.py, etc).
- You want aesthetic console output: spinner + timer during recording, green rolling transcripts, markdown pretty-print for agents.
- You want option [6] Agent Moneypenny (raw transcript to GPT) and option [7] Agent Maxwell (summarized coding prompts).
- You want live transcription support via gpt-4o-mini-transcribe, chunked recording in recorder, streamed updates in console.
- You prefer hyphens for repo-facing docs (GitHub style) and underscores for transient logs (Python style).
