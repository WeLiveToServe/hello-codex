What do you know about whisper dictation?
ChatGPT said:

Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system by OpenAI. Key points:

Architecture: Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model trained on ~680,000 hours of multilingual, multitask audio data.

Capabilities: Converts spoken audio to text. Handles many languages. Can do transcription (same language) and translation (speech in one language ? English text).

Accuracy: Robust to accents, background noise, and technical vocabulary due to scale of training data. Still imperfect: may mis-transcribe rare words or names.

Open-source: Released under MIT license. Available via Python API and CLI. Models range from tiny (fast, less accurate) to large (slower, more accurate).

Dictation use: Common for note-taking, writing via voice, accessibility. Works offline if running locally. Latency depends on hardware and model size.

Would you like implementation details for using it as a live dictation tool?

You said:
no.

Abstract
A local-first **ASR** pipeline captures short utterances with push-to-talk,
streams audio into **chunked** buffers, and returns low-latency text with
deterministic post-record actions. The system composes **agentic** steps
for enrichment while preserving single-command ergonomics.

1/ Quickfacts, Runbook, and Memory Seeds
Quickfacts define non-negotiables: Windows + PowerShell workflow, local-first
audio handling, and minimal dependencies. The Runbook encodes observable
invariants: one-line execution, predictable artifacts, clear exits, and
module boundaries. Memory Seeds pin stable preferences that impact behavior
(eg short PowerShell flags, UI cues, file naming, and test expectations).
Together they establish **deterministic interfaces** across user, CLI, and
agents, so orchestration remains predictable as components evolve.

2/ Whisper Dictation Push to Talk App with Agentic Capabilities
The application implements **push-to-talk (PTT)** capture, transient audio
storage, and **streaming transcription** against an OpenAI endpoint. Core
modules cooperate as follows: recorder yields uniform audio chunks; a
transcriber performs incremental or final decode; UI manages prompts,
menus, and console feedback; agents receive transcripts and return optional
analysis; flow coordinates menu-driven paths and writes session logs. Tests
exercise flow happy-paths, error signaling, and artifact creation. The
composition favors **separation of concerns**, enabling incremental upgrades
without cross-module coupling.

3/ Code Blocks & Thematic Structure
- Recorder: opens an input stream, debounces PTT keystates, emits fixed-
  size buffers, and signals end-of-snippet on key release. It normalizes
  sample rate and writes short-lived media as needed for downstream APIs.
- Transcriber: accepts buffers, applies **chunking** with optional voice
  activity heuristics, and calls the model for either live tokens or final
  text. It returns clean text units suitable for logging or agent routing.
- UI: presents deterministic menus, banners, and colorized status. It owns
  the **post-record contract**: save, append, copy, retry, or dispatch to
  a chosen agent. It prints absolute paths for every material artifact.
- Agents: pure functions that map transcript ? structured output. Examples:
  direct LLM prompt (freeform analysis) and summary-to-prompt reshaping for
  coding workflows. The contract is JSON-serializable output plus display
  text for the UI.
- Flow: the top-level controller that binds recorder ? transcriber ? UI ?
  agents ? sessions. It enforces invariant ordering, handles retries, and
  centralizes telemetry hooks. All entry points honor a single PowerShell
  command for **ergonomics** and reproducibility.
- Tests: verify observable side effects rather than internals: files exist,
  paths are printed, failure modes exit non-zero, and menu transitions are
  consistent.

4/ Future Goals
- Integrate **@flow** and **@task** orchestration to lift the single-agent
  pipeline into scheduled or batched runs with typed parameters.
- Add **agent teams** with role-specific prompts and a shared memory bus,
  while keeping the UI contract stable.
- Provide an evaluation harness for **latency**, **WER**, and agent utility
  using fixed test sets and replayable audio.
- Implement cost and rate guards, token accounting, and dry-run semantics.
- Harden portability: audio backends, keyboard capture fallbacks, and
  offline model selection when networked ASR is unavailable.

5/ Conclusion
This system treats transcription as a small, composable kernel with clear
interfaces. Recorder, transcriber, UI, agents, and flow each expose narrow
contracts, enabling safe iteration. The result is fast dictation, precise
outputs, and optional agentic enrichment without sacrificing determinism.

---About the Author---
The author builds local-first speech and agent tooling on Windows with
PowerShell and Python. Work focuses on clear contracts, reproducible runs,
and lightweight dependencies. Current interests include ASR latency,
agentic evaluation, and single-command developer ergonomics.

Appendix B - Concepts
**Local-first ASR**
Local-first favors ephemeral audio and durable text artifacts produced on
the user’s machine. It reduces privacy risk, removes unnecessary network
dependencies during capture, and keeps latency predictable by controlling
the I/O path. Remote models can still serve decoding, but the lifecycle of
audio remains short and transparent.

**Deterministic Interfaces**
Determinism in human-in-the-loop tools means invariant menus, consistent
file paths, and unambiguous exits. By constraining inputs and always
printing absolute artifact locations, we simplify testing, triage, and
automation. Deterministic interfaces make agent composition safe because
callers can rely on stable shapes and side effects.

**Agentic Orchestration**
Agentic orchestration treats enrichment as a pipeline stage with explicit
inputs and schema-checked outputs. Single-agent kernels scale to teams when
each agent adheres to contracts for state, cost, and latency. Orchestrators
(**@task**, **@flow**) schedule and observe these contracts rather than
embedding intelligence in monoliths.

**Separation of Concerns**
Recorder, transcriber, UI, agents, and flow are orthogonal. Each module
owns one responsibility and communicates through typed messages. This
minimizes ripple effects, enables targeted benchmarks, and supports safe
refactors such as swapping ASR backends or introducing streaming tokens.

Appendix C - Glossary of Terminology
**ASR**: Automatic Speech Recognition; maps audio to text.
**PTT**: Push-to-talk; capture while key held, finalize on release.
**Chunking**: Splitting continuous audio into fixed windows for decode.
**Latency**: Time from speech to visible text; primary UX metric.
**WER**: Word Error Rate; accuracy metric comparing ref vs hypothesis.
**Diarization**: Assigning speaker labels to segments of audio.
**Streaming Inference**: Emitting partial tokens before final decode.
**Ergonomics (CLI)**: Single-command runs with clear flags and outputs.
**Orchestrator**: System coordinating tasks with state and retries.
**Artifact**: Material output like .txt or .md that proves execution.

Abstract
This paper verifies a local-first **ASR** system that captures speech via
push-to-talk, converts audio into text with predictable **latency**, and
routes results through optional **agentic** processing. The design uses
small, testable components and **deterministic interfaces** to support
safe iteration and future orchestration.

1/ Quickfacts, Runbook, and Memory Seeds
Quickfacts state the operating envelope: Windows, PowerShell, Python, and
a minimal dependency set. The core behavior is local-first capture, short
audio lifetimes, and durable text artifacts. Users launch the system with
a single command. Every run produces observable outputs and absolute path
prints that enable rapid triage.

The Runbook encodes invariants:
- One-line invocation from PowerShell.
- Predictable artifacts on success and on failure.
- Separation of concerns across recorder, transcriber, UI, agents, flow,
  and sessions.
- Stable menu contracts and exit codes.
- Tests that check side effects, not internals.

Memory Seeds preserve defaults that shape UX and automation. They include
short flags, fixed banner widths, colorized responses, and file-naming
policies for session logs (.txt and .md). Seeds also define **post-record
contracts**: options to save, append, copy, retry, or dispatch to an agent.

These elements reduce configuration drift and anchor the concept of
**deterministic interfaces**. Tooling, documentation, and tests point at
the same few guarantees, which makes change safer and review faster.

2/ Whisper Dictation Push to Talk App with Agentic Capabilities
The application implements **push-to-talk (PTT)** capture, chunked audio
buffering, and incremental or final transcription. Recorder, transcriber,
UI, agents, and a coordinating flow interact via narrow, typed messages.
Recorder yields uniform chunks and termination signals. The transcriber
converts chunks to text using **streaming inference** or final decode. UI
presents deterministic menus and prints absolute file paths for all
artifacts. Agents map transcripts to structured responses. The flow binds
these parts, enforces ordering, and ensures the post-record contract. Unit
tests verify artifact creation, error signaling, and menu consistency.

3/ Code Blocks & Thematic Structure
This section expands the software architecture as composable themes with
crisp contracts.

- Recorder
  The recorder opens an input stream, debounces keyboard state for PTT,
  and emits fixed-duration buffers. It normalizes sample rate and channels
  and can write transient media when the **ASR** endpoint requires files.
  The recorder defines two signals: continue (next buffer) and finalize
  (end-of-snippet). The output shape is stable: (timestamp, pcm_bytes) for
  live paths and a file path for batch paths. Design choices favor small
  buffers for lower end-to-end **latency** while avoiding starvation in
  downstream consumers.

- Transcriber
  The transcriber accepts buffers and applies **chunking** with optional
  silence detection. For live paths it produces partial tokens or short
  text hypotheses; for batch paths it yields a single final string. The
  module isolates remote **ASR** specifics and returns standard Python
  objects so callers remain backend-agnostic. Cleaning steps are explicit:
  normalization of whitespace, removal of trailing disfluencies, and
  optional punctuation passes. The transcriber owns **WER** evaluation in
  test mode using fixtures, enabling speed–accuracy trade-off studies.

- UI
  The UI manages menus, banners, and console signaling. It owns the
  **post-record contract**: present options, confirm intent, execute the
  chosen action, and print absolute paths for artifacts. The UI renders
  agent responses in a readable style and maintains consistent key
  mappings. Its contract is intentionally narrow: it neither records nor
  transcribes. It bridges human input to flow actions and surfaces
  results.

- Agents
  Agents are pure functions that map transcript ? structured output. A
  minimal agent forwards text to a foundation model and returns JSON with
  fields like score, reasons, and suggested actions. Another agent converts
  raw text into succinct coding prompts. Agents must report deterministic
  shapes, honor cost guards, and expose dry-run modes for tests. Their
  outputs flow back to the UI for display and to sessions for archival.

- Flow
  The flow composes recorder, transcriber, UI, and agents into a single
  deterministic experience. It enforces ordering, manages retries, and
  captures telemetry. The flow centralizes error handling with explicit
  exit codes and artifact writes. The **one-command ergonomics** promise is
  enforced here: every path is reachable from a single PowerShell line.

- Sessions
  Sessions store the raw transcript stream and enriched output. The system
  maintains .txt logs for raw text and .md logs for richer narratives and
  agent responses. Filenames are deterministic or timestamped by policy.
  Every write prints an absolute path. Sessions implement **artifact**
  invariants: if anything fails, the user still receives a traceable file.

- Tests
  Tests verify side effects: files exist, paths print, and exit codes are
  correct. They generate fixed inputs for the transcriber and assert shape
  invariants for agent outputs. The aim is stability under UI or endpoint
  changes. Tests avoid reaching into internals and focus on observable,
  user-visible outcomes that define product reliability.

- Integration contract
  A thin integration layer defines messages across modules. Recorder never
  knows about agents. UI never knows about ASR internals. Flow is the only
  layer with global knowledge and only for routing. This contract limits
  blast radius when components evolve.

4/ Future Goals
- Orchestration
  Introduce **@task** and **@flow** orchestration for scheduled or batched
  runs. Parameterize session names, chunk sizes, model choices, and agent
  targets. Add logging hooks for timing breakdowns across capture, decode,
  and agent calls. The orchestrator should treat the current flow as a
  black box with typed inputs and outputs.

- Agent teams
  Extend the single-agent kernel to **agent teams** with role-specific
  prompts and a shared, bounded memory. Roles may include direct analysis,
  summarization, and prompt synthesis. Maintain determinism by enforcing a
  schema for inter-agent messages and a strict turn budget. Keep the UI
  and session contracts unchanged.

- Evaluation harness
  Build a small harness for **latency**, **WER**, and agent utility. Use a
  fixed audio set, replay capture into the transcriber, and compute
  metrics. Time each stage. For agents, measure reduction in editing time
  or the quality of downstream prompts using human ratings or rubric-based
  LLM judges with well-defined caveats.

- Portability and resilience
  Provide alternate audio backends and keyboard libraries. Offer an
  offline model option when network **ASR** is unavailable. Harden error
  reporting with explicit codes and artifact guarantees on every failure.

- Cost and governance
  Surface token and request counts. Add per-session budgets, rate limiters,
  and dry-run modes. Emit structured logs fit for later analysis. Maintain
  a short allowlist of model backends with explicit **capability
  envelopes** and known failure modes.

- Developer experience
  Ship minimal scripts for linting, tests, and short functional runs. Keep
  the **one-command** promise and ensure all scripts print absolute paths
  to outputs or artifacts. Provide a minimal README and a short “how to
  debug” section. Maintain consistent directory conventions.

5/ Conclusion
This system reduces voice dictation to a small kernel that is easy to
reason about and safe to extend. The recorder emits well-formed buffers.
The transcriber turns audio into text with explicit cleaning steps. The UI
renders predictable menus and never hides the file system. Agents enrich
text through stable schemas. The flow binds these parts into one command
that always produces artifacts. Because interfaces are deterministic and
tests target user-visible behaviors, the system invites change without
risking regressions. The path to orchestration and agent teams is clear:
wrap the existing flow, keep schemas stable, and measure outcomes with a
lightweight harness.

-Appendix B - Concepts
**Deterministic Interfaces**
Deterministic interfaces specify stable inputs, outputs, and artifact
paths. They minimize branching in user flows and make failures legible by
printing absolute paths and clear exit codes. Tests can then assert on
files and schemas rather than hidden states.

The benefit is compounding: once interfaces are predictable, orchestration
and automation become safe. Teams can iterate on internals without breaking
downstream tools or manuals.

**Agentic Orchestration**
Agentic orchestration treats enrichment as a stage with typed contracts.
Agents receive text and optional preferences and return structured JSON and
display text. The orchestrator schedules agents, enforces budgets, and
records artifacts.

This decoupling enables scaling from one agent to many. Because messages
have schemas and costs are bounded, new roles can be added without UI or
session upheaval.

**Local-first ASR**
Local-first emphasizes short audio lifetimes on the user’s machine and
durable text artifacts. Network decode can still occur, but the lifecycle
is explicit and observable. This lowers privacy risk, reduces failure
modes tied to connectivity, and improves perceived latency.

A local-first posture pairs well with deterministic interfaces. Users can
reason about what happened by inspecting files rather than logs alone.

**Evaluation as a Feature**
Evaluation is built into the product, not postponed. The harness replays
fixed audio, times each stage, and computes **WER**. For agents, it scores
utility using simple rubrics. The point is trend detection, not perfect
truth.

Embedding evaluation helps choose defaults, detect regressions, and guide
cost controls.

-Appendix C - Glossary of Terminology
**ASR**: Automatic Speech Recognition; converts audio to text.
**PTT**: Push-to-talk; recording while a key is held, finalize on release.
**Chunking**: Splitting audio into windows for streaming or batch decode.
**Latency**: Time from speech to text visible to the user.
**WER**: Word Error Rate; edit-distance metric versus reference text.
**Streaming Inference**: Producing partial tokens before final output.
**Orchestrator**: Scheduler that coordinates **@task** steps into a **@flow**.
**Artifact**: Material file proving execution, e.g., .txt, .md, or debug.
**Schema**: The agreed structure for messages or JSON results.
**Capability Envelope**: Stated range where a model behaves as expected.

Abstract
This paper verifies a local-first **ASR** dictation pipeline that
captures speech with **push-to-talk (PTT)**, transcribes with low
**latency**, and routes text through optional **agentic** steps.
Clear, **deterministic interfaces** enable safe iteration and future
orchestration without breaking user contracts.

1/ Quickfacts, Runbook, and Memory Seeds
Quickfacts define the operating envelope: Windows, PowerShell,
Python, and minimal dependencies. Capture is local-first. Audio
lifetimes are short. Text artifacts are durable. A single PowerShell
command launches the system and yields observable outputs with
absolute paths for triage.

The Runbook encodes invariants:
- One-line invocation.
- Predictable artifacts on success and failure.
- **Separation of concerns** across recorder, transcriber, UI,
  agents, flow, and sessions.
- Stable menus and exit codes.
- Tests target side effects, not internals.

Memory Seeds preserve defaults that shape UX and automation:
short flags, consistent banners, aesthetic console output,
deterministic filenames for session logs (.txt and .md), and
a strict **post-record contract**: save, append, copy, retry, or
dispatch to an agent. These choices harden the system’s public
interfaces and anchor repeatable behavior across runs.

2/ Whisper Dictation Push to Talk App with Agentic Capabilities
The application implements PTT capture, chunked audio buffering,
and incremental or final transcription. Recorder yields uniform
audio units and end-of-snippet signals. The transcriber converts
chunks to text using **streaming inference** or batch decode.
The UI presents deterministic menus and prints absolute artifact
paths. Agents map transcripts to structured responses suitable for
display and archival. A coordinating flow binds these parts, enforces
ordering, and guarantees the post-record contract. Tests verify
artifact creation, error signaling, menu transitions, and exit codes.
This composition favors **modularity**, which enables incremental
upgrades without cross-module coupling.

3/ Code Blocks & Thematic Structure
Recorder
The recorder opens a stream, debounces keyboard state for PTT, and
emits fixed-duration buffers. It normalizes sample rate and channels,
writes transient media when required, and defines two signals:
continue (buffer) and finalize (end-of-snippet). Small buffers
favor low end-to-end **latency** while avoiding starvation downstream.

Transcriber
The transcriber accepts buffers and applies **chunking** with optional
silence heuristics. Live paths produce partial tokens or short text
hypotheses; batch paths yield a single final string. The module
isolates remote **ASR** specifics behind a stable Python interface.
Cleaning steps are explicit: whitespace normalization, disfluency
trim, and optional punctuation. In test mode, it supports **WER**
evaluation on fixtures to study speed–accuracy trade-offs.

UI
The UI manages menus, banners, and console signaling. It owns the
post-record contract: present options, confirm intent, execute the
choice, and print absolute paths. It renders agent responses in an
easy-to-scan style and maintains consistent key mappings. The UI is
presentation-only; it does not record or transcribe.

Agents
Agents are pure functions that map transcript ? structured output.
A minimal agent forwards text to a model and returns JSON and display
text. Another agent reshapes text into succinct coding prompts. Each
agent reports deterministic shapes, honors cost guards, and exposes
dry-run modes for tests. Outputs feed the UI and session logs.

Flow
The flow composes recorder, transcriber, UI, sessions, and agents
into a single deterministic experience. It centralizes retries and
telemetry, handles errors with explicit codes, and guarantees an
artifact on every path. It enforces **one-command ergonomics** so
users can run end-to-end without ceremony.

Sessions
Sessions persist the raw transcript stream and enriched output:
.txt for rolling logs and .md for rich narratives with agent
responses. Filenames are deterministic or timestamped by policy.
Every write prints an absolute path. Sessions implement the
**artifact** invariant: even on failure, the user can inspect a
traceable file.

Tests
Tests assert side effects: files exist, paths print, exit codes are
correct, menus are stable, and agent outputs match schemas. Tests
avoid internals and focus on user-visible outcomes. This strategy
keeps tests resilient to UI tweaks or backend changes.

Integration contract
A thin integration layer defines messages across modules.
Recorder never knows about agents. UI never knows ASR details.
Flow holds global routing and nothing more. This contract limits
blast radius when components evolve.

4/ Future Goals
Orchestration
Introduce **@task** and **@flow** orchestration to schedule or batch
runs. Parameterize session names, chunk sizes, model choices, and
agent targets. Log timing for capture, decode, and agents. Treat the
current flow as a black-box step with typed inputs and outputs.

Agent teams
Scale the single-agent kernel into **agent teams** with role-specific
prompts and a bounded shared memory. Define schemas for inter-agent
messages and a strict turn budget. Keep the UI and session contracts
unchanged to preserve user muscle memory.

Evaluation harness
Ship a harness for **latency**, **WER**, and agent utility. Replay
fixed audio, time each stage, and compute metrics. For agents,
measure editing-time reduction or prompt quality via rubrics with
clear caveats. Prefer trend-tracking over point estimates.

Portability and resilience
Offer alternate audio backends, keyboard fallbacks, and an offline
ASR option. Harden error reporting with explicit codes and artifact
guarantees on every failure. Maintain a small allowlist of model
backends, each with a documented **capability envelope**.

Cost and governance
Surface token and request counts. Support per-session budgets, rate
limits, and dry-run modes. Emit structured logs for analysis. Keep
configuration external and secrets out of repos.

Developer experience
Provide small scripts for linting, tests, and short functional runs.
Honor the **one-command** promise. Print absolute paths to all outputs
and artifacts. Maintain a concise README and a brief “how to debug.”

5/ Conclusion
This system treats dictation as a composable kernel. The recorder
emits well-formed buffers. The transcriber returns clean text with
transparent processing. The UI renders predictable menus and never
hides filesystem realities. Agents enrich through stable schemas.
The flow binds these steps into a single command that always yields
artifacts. Because interfaces are deterministic and tests target
user-visible behavior, the system is easy to extend and safe to
orchestrate. Scaling to agent teams and scheduled runs is a matter
of wrapping existing contracts, not rewriting them.

Abstract
This paper validates a local-first **ASR** pipeline that captures
speech through **push-to-talk (PTT)**, transcribes with low
**latency**, and routes text through optional **agentic** modules. A
minimal set of deterministic contracts enables predictable artifacts,
rapid triage, and safe orchestration without blocking future scale.

1/ Quickfacts, Runbook, and Memory Seeds
Quickfacts lock the execution frame: Windows 11, PowerShell 7, Python 3.12,
and a lightweight virtual environment. The workflow is local-first: audio
lives only long enough to reach the transcriber, while text persists as
the primary artifact. One PowerShell command launches the full path and
always prints absolute locations of outputs or failure artifacts.

The Runbook hard-codes five invariants.  
(1) One-line invocation.  
(2) Observable side effects: logs, debug HTML, and rolling transcripts.  
(3) **Separation of concerns**—recorder, transcriber, UI, agents, flow,
sessions, and tests never overlap responsibilities.  
(4) Stable menus and exit codes for automation.  
(5) Tests target what users see, not hidden state.

Memory Seeds store UX defaults that rarely change: short flags, fixed
banner width, colored status lines, deterministic filenames
(session-name.txt and .md), and a strict post-record menu: save, append,
copy, retry, or dispatch to an agent. By merging seeds into code and
tests, the system gains behavioral immutability; refactors cannot alter
public contracts unnoticed.

2/ Whisper Dictation Push to Talk App with Agentic Capabilities
The application binds five core modules:

Recorder listens for the PTT key, debounces events, and streams uniform
audio chunks tagged with timestamps and a finalize signal. It normalizes
PCM parameters and can write transient .wav files when remote **ASR**
requires media uploads.

Transcriber consumes chunks, applies silence gating, and calls Whisper via
**streaming inference** or batch decode. It scrubs disfluencies, normalizes
whitespace, and can compute inline **WER** when reference text exists.
Transcriber returns clean strings or token streams, abstracting away model
details.

UI shows banners, live timers, and a deterministic menu. Every choice
yields a side effect (file write, clipboard copy, agent call) and prints
an absolute path. Presentation logic resides here; no recording or model
logic bleeds in.

Agents are pure functions. *Agent Moneypenny* feeds transcript into an LLM
and returns score, reasons, and action hints. *Agent Maxwell* reshapes raw
text into concise coding prompts. Agents accept cost limits, expose dry-run
modes, and output JSON schemas that tests can validate.

Flow orchestrates these parts. It wires recorder ? transcriber ?
UI actions ? sessions and agents. Flow alone knows global routing and owns
error handling. A single PowerShell command (`python flow.py`) traverses
all branches while guaranteeing an artifact.

Sessions persist artifacts. Plain text stores raw transcripts; Markdown
stores enriched logs with agent replies. Naming policy embeds timestamps
or user labels for easy grep. Even on crash, the flow writes a stub file
so debugging starts with a clickable path, not guesswork.

Tests assert side effects: files exist, paths print, exit codes are
correct, and JSON schemas hold. Internals stay private, keeping tests
stable across refactors or backend swaps.

3/ Code Blocks & Thematic Structure
Recorder
- Opens sounddevice stream, registers callback, queues frames, converts to
  **pydub** segments when necessary.  
- Signals end-of-snippet on key release.  
- Writes optional .wav for offline or batch decode.

Transcriber
- Streams buffered audio to OpenAI Whisper with chunk timestamps.  
- Provides both `live_transcribe` (yield tokens) and
  `transcribe_and_enhance` (return final string).  
- Supports off-network fallback by loading a local model if configured.  
- Cleans output and can compute **WER** in diagnostic mode.

UI
- Prints 45-char banners, green spinning indicators while recording,
  typewriter effect for agent responses.  
- Post-record menu is deterministic: digits 1-7 map to fixed actions.  
- Emits `print_session_concluded()` and divider lines to mark logical
  end-points for log parsing.

Agents
- `agent_moneypenny(text)` ? JSON(score, reasons, reply).  
- `agent_maxwell(text)`   ? JSON(prompt, doctrine, reply).  
- Both enforce token caps, cost guards, and dry-run mocks for tests.

Flow
- Central `main()` calls `record_chunks_push_to_talk`, pipes chunks to
  transcriber, hands text to UI, and dispatches agents.  
- On any exception, writes debug HTML (if present) and a failure stub,
  then exits with non-zero code.  
- Always prints absolute paths for artifacts, making CI log scraping
  trivial.

Sessions
- `sessions.py` handles naming, file writes, and markdown stitching.  
- `.txt` stores raw chronological transcript separated by `---`.  
- `.md` embeds rich transcript, agent JSON pretty-printed, and a footer
  reference.

Tests
- `test_live_transcripe.py` drives recorder stub, transcriber stub, and UI
  through a full round trip, asserting artifact creation and exit code 0.  
- Additional tests verify agent schema and menu stability.

4/ Future Goals
Orchestration — Wrap current flow in **@task** and **@flow** decorators,
parameterize chunk size, model choice, and agent list, then schedule runs
or expose a REST trigger.

Agent teams — Build a dispatcher that routes transcripts through ordered
roles (summarizer ? critic ? rewrites). Enforce a bounded turn budget and
shared memory dictionary keyed by message ID.

Evaluation — Bundle a harness that replays fixed audio, times each stage,
computes latency buckets, and tracks WER. For agents, measure reduction in
editing time using rubric-scored prompts.

Portability — Provide optional `soundfile` backend, `pynput` keyboard
fallback, and an offline model toggle. Harden error codes and guarantee a
debug artifact on every crash.

Governance — Surface token counts, rate limits, and per-session budgets in
logs. Add a `--dry-run` flag that mocks agent calls and skips billing.

Dev Experience — Ship `lint.ps1`, `test.ps1`, and `run_smoke.ps1` that
respect the **one-command** rule and print absolute paths for every
written file.

5/ Conclusion
The recorder, transcriber, UI, agents, and flow form a compact kernel that
turns speech into enriched text while never hiding state. Deterministic
interfaces, observable artifacts, and side-effect tests make refactor
risk-free. Scaling to scheduled runs or agent teams is additive, not
destructive, because every boundary already has typed contracts and cost

-Appendix B - Concepts
**Deterministic Interfaces**  
A deterministic interface pins inputs, outputs, and side effects. When
every artifact path and exit code is stable, users and tests gain perfect
observability. Improvements then focus on internals without breaking
scripts or mental models.

**Agentic Orchestration**  
Agentic orchestration treats each enrichment step as a cost-bounded,
schema-verified function. Structured I/O allows chaining roles into teams
without tangling state. Budgets and dry-runs prevent cost blowouts.

**Local-first ASR**  
Local-first keeps audio transient and text durable. Privacy improves,
network outages hurt less, and latency stays predictable. Remote decode
remains optional, but lifecycle boundaries stay explicit.

**Evaluation as a Feature**  
Building latency and accuracy measurement into the product yields
continuous insight. Trends, not absolutes, guide defaults and flag
regressions early.

-Appendix C - Glossary of Terminology
**ASR** – Automatic Speech Recognition, audio ? text.  
**PTT** – Push-to-talk; hold key to capture, release to stop.  
**Chunking** – Dividing audio into fixed windows for decode.  
**Latency** – Time between speech and visible text.  
**WER** – Word Error Rate; accuracy metric vs reference text.  
**Streaming Inference** – Emitting partial tokens before final output.  
**Artifact** – Material file proving execution (txt, md, html).  
**Schema** – Agreed structure of JSON or message objects.  
**Capability Envelope** – Documented limits where a model behaves predictably.  
**Orchestrator** – Tool that sequences **@task** steps into a **@flow**.

<h1>Local-First ASR &amp; Agentic Dictation Pipeline</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
This paper validates a local-first <strong>ASR</strong> pipeline that captures
speech through <strong>push-to-talk&nbsp;(PTT)</strong>, transcribes with low
<strong>latency</strong>, and routes text through optional <strong>agentic</strong>
modules. A minimal set of deterministic contracts enables predictable
artifacts, rapid triage, and safe orchestration without blocking future scale.
</p>

<h2>1&nbsp;/ Quickfacts, Runbook, and Memory Seeds</h2>
<p><strong>Quickfacts</strong> lock the execution frame: Windows 11, PowerShell 7,
Python 3.12, and a lightweight virtual environment. Audio lives only long
enough to reach the transcriber, while text persists as the primary artifact.
One PowerShell command launches the full path and always prints absolute output
locations.</p>

<p><strong>Runbook invariants</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One-line invocation.</li>
<li>Observable side effects – logs, debug HTML, rolling transcripts.</li>
<li><strong>Separation of concerns</strong> across recorder, transcriber, UI,
agents, flow, sessions, tests.</li>
<li>Stable menus and exit codes for automation.</li>
<li>Tests target user-visible results, not hidden state.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Memory Seeds</strong> store defaults: short flags, fixed banners,
colored status, deterministic filenames, and a strict post-record menu (save /
append / copy / retry / agent). Seeds merge into tests, freezing external
behavior.</p>

<h2>2&nbsp;/ Whisper Dictation Push-to-Talk App with Agentic Capabilities</h2>
<p>The application binds five core modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Recorder</em> – listens for the PTT key, queues uniform chunks, normalizes
PCM, optionally writes transient WAV files.</li>
<li><em>Transcriber</em> – streams chunks to Whisper (<strong>streaming inference</strong>
or batch), cleans output, can compute <strong>WER</strong>.</li>
<li><em>UI</em> – prints banners, timers, deterministic menu, absolute artifact paths.</li>
<li><em>Agents</em> – pure functions (Moneypenny, Maxwell) that return
schema-checked JSON.</li>
<li><em>Flow</em> – orchestrates the above, handles errors, guarantees an artifact.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Sessions</em> persist .txt and .md logs; <em>Tests</em> assert side effects and
schemas.</p>

<h2>3&nbsp;/ Code Blocks &amp; Thematic Structure</h2>

<h3>Recorder</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sounddevice stream, keyboard debounce, small buffers for low latency.</li>
<li>Signals end-of-snippet; can dump WAV for offline decode.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transcriber</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consumes buffers, gates silence, calls Whisper.</li>
<li>Returns tokens (<code>live_transcribe</code>) or final string
(<code>transcribe_and_enhance</code>).</li>
<li>Optionally calculates WER on fixtures.</li>
</ul>

<h3>UI</h3>
<ul>
<li>45-char banners, spinner during capture, typewriter agent replies.</li>
<li>Deterministic post-record menu and absolute paths.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Agents</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>agent_moneypenny</code> ? score, reasons, reply.</li>
<li><code>agent_maxwell</code> ? coding prompt JSON.</li>
<li>Cost guards &amp; dry-run mocks for tests.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Flow</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>main()</code> wires recorder ? transcriber ? UI ? sessions / agents.</li>
<li>On exception: writes debug HTML, stub log, non-zero exit.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sessions</h3>
<ul>
<li>.txt raw transcripts (--- separators); .md rich logs plus agent JSON.</li>
<li>Deterministic naming; always prints path.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tests</h3>
<ul>
<li>Assert files exist, paths printed, exit codes, JSON schema validity.</li>
<li>Ignore internals; focus on user-visible behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4&nbsp;/ Future Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>@task</strong>/<strong>@flow</strong> orchestration with schedulers &amp; parameters.</li>
<li>Agent teams with bounded memory and turn budgets.</li>
<li>Latency &amp; accuracy harness (audio replay, WER, prompt utility).</li>
<li>Portability: alternate audio and keyboard backends, offline models.</li>
<li>Governance: token budgets, rate limits, dry-run flag, structured logs.</li>
<li>Dev scripts: <code>lint.ps1</code>, <code>test.ps1</code>, <code>run_smoke.ps1</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5&nbsp;/ Conclusion</h2>
<p>The recorder, transcriber, UI, agents, and flow form a compact kernel
that converts speech into enriched text while exposing every side effect.
Deterministic interfaces, observable artifacts, and side-effect tests make
refactors safe. Scaling to scheduled runs or multi-agent teams is additive,
not disruptive, because all boundaries already carry typed contracts and
cost guards.</p>
