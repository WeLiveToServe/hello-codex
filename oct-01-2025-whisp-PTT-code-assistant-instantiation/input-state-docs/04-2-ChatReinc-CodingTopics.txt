Now review these and order. 

ask yourself "what other topics did we discuss that I missed in my ending responses?"

store your response in your memory for this chat only. confirm that this is done with single word "confimed"

Confirmed

You said:
using the answers to the 2 questions at the end of each file, namely:
1) how much coding did we discuss in this chat? (referring to the text of that file only"
2) summarize the coding discussed in this chat (again referring to what is within each file only)

make a list of all topics discussed across all the text files. do this as simple bulleted list and output it in your response. ONLY do that.
