now review all of the text files again, make a list, with a sentence description each, of topics covered that were INDIVIDUAL to what I was trying to do, what personal interests in coding only we worked on together. this can include technical topics but really should be a high level description of things I asked about and you taught me to do. 

repeat back what I am asking you to do in this prompt briefly.

You want me to:

Re-review all 8 uploaded chat archives.

Identify topics that were individual to your personal coding goals (not just generic coding references).

For each topic, write a one-sentence description of what you specifically asked about and what I taught you to do.

Keep the focus on your personal coding interests and projects, not just technical lists.

You said:
yes. go ahead and do that. this should be at least 30 items long.

Structure repos for orchestration projects with YAML configs and diagrams.

Next:

Add scheduling and deployments in Prefect Cloud.

Connect flows to external APIs (scraping, job data, AI calls).

Git & GitHub

Now:

Initialize repos, branch, commit, merge, and push.

Use GitHub CLI (gh repo create) to make repos from the terminal.

Write .gitignore and manage secrets safely.

Next:

Learn pull requests, forks, and collaboration workflows.

Add GitHub Actions for automated testing and linting.

Job APIs & Scraping

Expand scraper to multiple sites with plug-in architecture.

Repo & Project Setup

Now:

Set up virtual environments in Windows Terminal.

Create minimal repo structure (src/, data/, tests/).

Write README.md, .gitignore, and requirements.txt.

Next:

Add unit tests with pytest.

Use Docker for containerized project setup.

AI Integration

Use VS Code terminal, extensions, and understand syntax highlighting.

Next:

Deepen Pandas (joins, aggregations, pipelines).
