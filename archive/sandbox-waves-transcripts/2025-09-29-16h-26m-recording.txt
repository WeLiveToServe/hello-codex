Alright, here we go. I'm making cacio e pepe for the kids. It's an Italian dish that means "cheese and pepper." Poor Sarah is having a really tough time with her teeth; I feel terrible for her. This club thing is incredible. It's actually making improvements I wouldn't have even considered without anyone asking me. 

So, we're calling it OpenAI. I can't believe this! I'm glad it turned out this way. I'm also roasting some chicken drumsticks, and honestly, I could keep this going all day. It's amazing how you can just keep adding to it and automate everything. Mind-blowing!
