well I ended up being really frustrated with my really crowded chat GPT-5 instance so I got the quick facts and run books and memory seeds together use some of the chat reboot stuff from before on letter from mentor and coding stuff so far personal coding stuff I had the last model generate readme file and also write like a thousand page description of the whisper thing I rebooted this new model it was incredible it was incredible it refactored stuff it split stuff out so now there's now there is a UI file on its own now there is a sessions file on its own there's tests flow looks great everything's looking better we pass stuff up to an agent through transcript it was incredible I did almost lose two files at the end but and I'm so happy with it I'm happy with this basic functionality this passing voice stuff up to an agent or to a model at open AI holy shit that's incredible I love everything about this things to do tomorrow I got to renewing those files I deleted because that was real bad I what else do I have to do I got to add some more agents with structured prompts and whatnot I got to figure out some more models to call to that should be a cool option as you can send and call the different models honestly you may as well be able to open up a text chat in here to chat with them on the fly yeah this is really really really really really cool
