All right, we are going to start a new session here, which I have labeled "Keith CodeFlow." I want to use this to express my thoughts aloud so that a coding assistant like you can help me execute them. So far, I love this.

I think there is some aesthetic cleanup needed, but I don't care too much about that. I do want to mention that I like the release space to pause and backspace to finish features; that's absolutely fine. 

Also, remind me that I want to nuke the old directories because we don't need them anymore. Additionally, I want to ask you about a summary transcription option. Essentially, at a certain point, I would like you to call the OpenAI API to summarize a whole transcript file, allowing us to condense it, and then people can continue adding to it from there. 

Okay, this is brilliant!

This is a good option to consider. It showed me the enhanced transcript for what I just recorded, which is great. However, in this re-recording session, I would like to read everything so far to review it and see if it makes sense. That reminds me, in the beginning option, if we're continuing another session, let's ask if I want to read the existing transcript first.
